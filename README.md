# Playwright API testing Practice Project

I created this project for some PoC and R&D into API testing with Playwright:

## Practice Notes App by Expand Testing

The test web app I selected is

- https://practice.expandtesting.com/notes/app/

This project contains UI and API tests. The goal is to have UI tests that use API calls as well as having separate API tests.

After forking, execute the following command:

```bash
  npm install
```

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
  npx playwright test
```
